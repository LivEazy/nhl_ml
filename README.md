### api access setup
- create file called "api_acess.py"
```python
    username = "YOUR_USERNAME"
    password = "YOUR_PASSWORD"
```

Then access.py already imports those variables from that file,
so you should be good to go :thumbsup:

Also the .gitignore file is set to hide that file and .pyc files which are created from the import usage :thumbsup:
